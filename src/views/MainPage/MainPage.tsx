                    The main reason for using TypeScript is to add static typing to JavaScript. Static typing means that the type of a variable cannot be changed at any point in a program. It can prevent a LOT of bugs!

                    On the other hand, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can change type.</div>
